# Payment Gateway- API Gateway (Go)

This is the API Gateway microservice developed in Go, part of the Payment Gateway project.

## About the Project

The Payment Gateway is a distributed system composed of:
- Frontend in Next.js
- API Gateway in Go (this repository)
- Anti-fraud system in Nest.js
- Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication

## Current status of the project
So far, we have implemented:
- Setup and base structure of the project
- Account management endpoints (creation and consultation)
- Complete invoice system with:
- Automatic creation and processing of payments
- Limit validation (invoices > R$ 10,000 are pending)
- Individual consultation and listing of invoices
- Automatic update of account balance

Pending features:
- Integration with Apache Kafka for:
- Sending transactions to the anti-fraud microservice
- Consumption of responses from the anti-fraud service
- Payment processing based on fraud analysis

## Testing the API

The project includes a `test.http` file that can be used with the VS Code REST Client extension. This file contains:
- Pre-configured global variables
- Examples of all requests
- Automatic API Key capture after account creation

To use:
1. Install the REST Client extension in VS Code
2. Open the `test.http` file
3. Click "Send Request" above each request
